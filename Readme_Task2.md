Movie Rating Prediction — CodSoft Data Science Internship


This project predicts user ratings for movies using historical data. It demonstrates machine learning techniques to build predictive models and can serve as a basic recommendation system.

Project Workflow:
Import Required Libraries
Load and Explore Dataset
Data Pre-processing
Handling Missing Values
Feature Engineering
Train–Test Split
Model Training (Linear Regression / Random Forest)
Accuracy Evaluation
Save Trained Model
Generate Predictions (movie_predictions.csv)

Repository Files:
Untitled7.ipynb  Jupyter Notebook containing full project code
movie_rating_dataset.csv — Original dataset
movie_rating_model.pkl — Serialized (saved) trained ML model
movie_predictions.csv — Predicted ratings

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

How to Run This Project
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Saideepthi30/CODSOFT.git
cd CODSOFT
Open the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook Untitled7.ipynb
Run all cells to train and evaluate the model.
To use the saved model directly:
python
import pickle
model = pickle.load(open("movie_rating_model.pkl", "rb"))
# Use model.predict() for new predictions

Internship Information:
This project is Task-2 of the CodSoft Data Science Internship — November Batch.

Future Enhancements:
Try different ML models (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting)
Build a GUI or web app using Streamlit
Deploy online as a recommendation system
